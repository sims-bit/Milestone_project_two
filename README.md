## Knifey Spooney

-Description-
Knifey Spooney is a game that is a rift on the classic game Rock Paper Scissors whick I have further evolved from a pop-culture reference. The game is a one player game, played against the computer.

The pop-culture reference stems from a scene within The Simpsons TV show. 
Follow the link to see the original scene - [The-Simpsons-Knifey-Spooney](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=knifey+spoony)

The game abides by the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules however with new weapons to choose from. The game has three rounds. 
At the end of the game the winning or loosing message will appear on screen. The winner message - "AHHH I see you've played knifey spooney before mate!" and the loosing message - "Thats not a knife! This is a knife!"
